# [Akshika Munshi](https://github.com/Akshika-Munshi)
- ðŸ‘‹ I'm a 2nd year ELC engineering student , who is fasicnated with the world of Computer Science and yet bash commands, enigmatic algorithm and holding up conversations with strangers seem to scare me. 
 
- Iâ€™m interested in ... basically, everything under and around the sun  , mostly in the nerd stuff like reverse engineering , creating cool looking websites ,quantum computing , 3D modelling and animation , object rendering , creating music and lately , playing Bandit games ðŸ‘€.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... more about everything ! Python , C , Competitive cooding , Object rendering , Video Making and Editing  also ,about myself.

-  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that could lead me to free cool coding merchandise,lol. Any beginner friendly projects , where i might be able to pitch in with knowlege of C language , HTML , Blender3.0 and python usage would interest me . Also open to new learning/ internship projects on the same .
