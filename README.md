# @Akshika-Munshi
- ðŸ‘‹ I'm a 1st year ELC engineering student , who is fasicnated with the world of Computer Science and yet bash commands, unsolocited python codes and holding up a conversation seem to scare me.  
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ... basically, everything under and around the sun  , mostly in the tech nerd stuff like reverse engineering , creating cool looking websites ,quantum computing  3D modelling and animation , object rendering , creating music and lately , playing Bandit games .
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... more about everything ! Python , C , Competitive cooding , 
-  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that could lead me to free merchandise . Also , any beginner friendly projects , where i might be able to pitch in with my reserved knowlege of C language , HTML , Blender3.0 and python usage would interest me . Also open to new learning/ internship projects on the same .
